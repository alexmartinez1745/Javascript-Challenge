# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Code Languages (Limitations)
* Challenge requested that only pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js are to be used on the web page.

## Background-Challenge

Challenge collected all of the eye-witness reports of UFO sightings! Requested to put this information online for the world to see.

Create a table dynamically based upon the dataset provided. Allow filtering of the table data for specific values.

## Steps Taken
### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, created code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match the user's input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Using multiple `input` tags, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
